/*
 
QTDummyComponent.h and QTDummyComponent.m define a dummy "Sequence Grabber Panel" (sgpn) component. It has no functionality in itself. Its sole purpose is to be registered. It has the same signature (type, subtype, creator) as the sgpn component that macam.component uses. But it has a higher version number. It is registered to the component database before QuickTime is launched. Now QuickTime considers macam.component to be outdated and therefore doesn't even try to load it any more.
 
Caution! Higher art of dirty workaround. Don't try this at home... :)
